# Memoization
After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7EjmdQzPqY) I thought I would write a function wrapper to make use of the concept. Feel free to use it however you like - just do not hold me responsible. It has not been tested in a real setting. I would recommend using '@lru_cache' from the 'functools' module.
